# HamGNN-Q: Predicting Charged Defect Hamiltonians with Equivariant Graph Neural Networks

**HamGNN-Q** is a graph neural network tool for predicting DFT-quality Hamiltonian matrices of materials systems — including both **perfect** and **defective structures**, with arbitrary charge states — without requiring quantum mechanical calculations.

## What It Does
-Predicts Hamiltonian Matrices directly from atomic structures and background charges

-Supports charged or neutral systems, including point defects, vacancies, interstitials, or perfect crystals

-Handles varied charge states through a background charge embedding

-Enables downstream tasks such as:

-Polaron wavefunction estimation

-Electronic property analysis

-Defect state localization studies
